	<h6> so like its sunday rn and i js went to basketball training yesterday, it was so sigma!!, we did a opening prayer, had some stretches exersizes and tests, then we played a game, i think that was quite fun, <br/> so like one of my classmates from school was that, lets call him "POTATO" so "POTATO" was helping me with memorizing stuff, and telling me what i needed, my dad and brother were also there with me n stuff, <br/> when we had water breaks (lasts only 2 mins) i would go to my dad and drink from the water he brought, :-D, after training we had a really pretty nice ride back, i forgot to mention the place there was SOOOOOOOOO PRETTY <br/> it was so beatiful fr, then on our drive back home we dropped by a convience store and got "mugu mugu" (jelly drink) and do bags'o chips, one for me, and one for my brother, (piatos) <br/> and i got a spicy cheesy flavor, my brother got the usual sourcream flavor. Then today on 11/30/2025 i went to church as usual, i brought my sling bag and a folded piece of paper that me and my cousins drew in when i got there, i stayed pretty late at church and my parents even got me takeout from chowking (resturant) while i was there <br/> and i ate my food and was playing and drawing with my friends, first is a girl lets call her "CHAIR" and the other a boy, lets call him "TABLE" so me "CHAIR" and "TABLE" were talking chatting drawing together, yk js normal sutff <br/> then "TABLE" said he actually brought his laptop with him today (it was pretty late by this point so all the church activites stopped) so we got on his laptop and watched some vids, listened to some music, and played some games, at some point he let me log into my roblox account on his laptop and we playe stuff like <br/> "femboy tycoon" "cartride into pregnant elliot" "baku deku sad story" and other stuff i picked some engineering game, i forgor the name. Theres a bunch of othe lil small details, but i guess i'll end the blog here, k bye!!! :DDD <br/> - Chubber 11/30/2025  </h6>
